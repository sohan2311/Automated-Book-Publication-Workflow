THE GATES OF MORNING - HUMAN EDITED VERSION
Rayson woke suddenly to the quiet night. The moonlight fell across the floor through the window slats. Outside, the coconut palms swayed softly.
He heard a faint humming noise coming from the reef - not the sea or the wind - something mechanical, distant. Curious, he rose and walked to the window.
A mysterious light moved along the reef's edge, vanishing and reappearing behind rocks.
The voices he heard on the wind were far away and indistinct.
After watching for some time, Rayson threw on a cloak and silently left his room to investigate the strange scene.
